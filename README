=amqp-js
amqp-js is an attempt to bring low-latency message queuing to javascript, without the using HTTP.  amqp-js works by joining
forces with actionscript to establish socket connections to your AMQP server.


=Requirements
1. AMQP Server
	RabbitMQ: http://www.rabbitmq.com/
	ActiveMQ: http://activemq.apache.org/
	Qpid: http://qpid.apache.org/
	ZeroMQ: http://www.zeromq.org/
	I use RabbitMQ...
2. Web Server
3. Basic understanding of message queuing.

=Flash Policy Files (eeeek!)
If you happen to run your AMQP server on a different server than that which you host your website, then a few extra steps
are required to get everything working together.  Since amqp-js uses flash to bind to sockets, it's important that you
understand how flash deals with sockets.

The following article will help you understand flash policy files

Your AMQP server will need to dish out flash policy files on port 843.  Check the system directory to get access to an example
flash policy file, a python script to host them, and an init script to daemonize the flash polciy server.

=Security
Well... I wouldn't use this for anything that requires security.  No promises.
